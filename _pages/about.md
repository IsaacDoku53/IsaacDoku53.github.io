I am a lecturer at the [Department of Economics Education, University of Education, Winneba-Ghana](https://www.uew.edu.gh/economics-edu/staff/idoku) and a [Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley](https://cega.berkeley.edu/user-type/fellows/?query=Isaac+Doku&country=all&initiatives=all&sector=all&themes=all&current_fellow=all&graduate_year=all). <br>

My research area is development economics with much emphasis on how developing countries can mitigate and  adapt to climate change, and education interventions in developing countries. I have played a leading role in evaluating two Government of Ghana's Energy policies: Environmental, health and safety sensitization and the free cookstove distribution model in rural and periurban areas in Ghana; and determining willingness-to-pay for solar lanterns in rural Ghana. I am also a JPAL African scholar that has currently won grants to carry out need assessment for re-integrating teenage mothers into the formal education system in Nigeria. In 2018, i was awarded the prestigious Emerald Literati Award for our study on Chinese FDI and economic growth of Africa. <br>
