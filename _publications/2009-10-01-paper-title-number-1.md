excerpt: 'To unearth the influence of climate finance (CF) on women-hunger alleviation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the study used unbalanced panel data for 43 SSA countries for the period 2006â€“2018. Data was analysed using system-GMM to deal with the endogeneity problem inherent in the model, among other panel regression estimators. Also, the sensitivity of the estimates was carried out using panel fixed effect quantile regression. The findings showed that CF and its components have a significant effect on women-hunger alleviation in SSA, apart from FDI.'
